I met some strangers and made a game!
Developed in Unity at the 2018 Global Game Jam, M1D1 is a sidescroller / rhythm game about robots and the meaning of home.

The Global Game Jam is an annual, worldwide event for designers & hobbyists alike to get together over the weekend and make a game - from concept to finish in 48 hours.

Legend has it, as the end of the weekend nears & the uploads start rolling in, server strain can get so bad as to prevent last-minute submissions from uploading in time.
If I recall correctly, we were pretty down to the wire, so we made the difficult decision to upload our game before the Mac build had compiled. (Good thing, too!)

So if you're on Mac & wanna try it out, [here](/other/M1D1.app.zip).

You can also check out [our project page](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/m1d1) for the Windows executable, as well as a copy of our project files.

M1D1 was made by Thomas Protheroe, Tom Van Manen, Ali Leriger de la Plante & Dylan Kelk.
