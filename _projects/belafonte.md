I love iTerm2's Belafonte preset so much that I'm making a vim colorscheme to match.

Belafonte.vim's internals are a [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) hack, so it's fully compatible with any syntax highlighting scheme that Gruvbox can handle.
The colours themselves were taken from [Belafonte for iTerm2](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/) & tweaked to minimize visual strain in the new context.

Right now it's pretty much functional, I just haven't gotten around to giving it a once over. If 2020's over and I still haven't shared a link, give me a shout.
