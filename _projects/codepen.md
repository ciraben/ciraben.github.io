Check out my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ciraben) for a collection of micro-projects I've completed as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. If nothing else, you'll gain some insight into my sense of humour. If there's one page to look at, I'd say check out my [quote machine](https://codepen.io/ciraben/pen/bGeNEzw).
