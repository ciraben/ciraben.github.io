Hello, Zuko here.

I grew up in suburban Vancouver, on the unceded land of the Kwantlen nation. 
My mum & dad's families immigrated from England & Holland in the '40s, to Brantford, on the Six Nations' [Haldimand tract](http://grandrivercountry.org/haldimand-tract/). 
Before that, it's pretty much history. 
I know that at some point, our ancestors were probably farmers & weavers — not a lot of IT demand, I guess.

I graduated with my BSc from UVic in 2014, joint majoring in Mathematics & Physics, minoring in Ocean Sciences.
If you're curious what that looked like in practice, [here](/other/thesis.pdf).
Near the end of my program, I started auditing gender theory classes too. I began experimenting with my own gender, and it stuck.

Summer 2014, I became enamoured with text-based games. 
I taught myself enough Python to make a couple of my own, then switched gears & developed an `.xml` GUI template for the expansive [Discworld MUD](http://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/).

In 2015, I moved on to speedrunning, and put my childhood Pokémon skills to the test [glitching](http://wiki.pokemonspeedruns.com/index.php/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red/Blue/Yellow_DSum_Manipulation) my way through the original games.
Although it was a short phase, it piqued my interest in "retro backend" and in 2016, I began poking around my laptop in command line to see what I could find.

Turns out, a lot.

So, this blog is a bit of a cheatsheet on the things I've learned. If it helps someone else, that'd be pretty cool too.

These days, you might find me hanging around #hardfought on IRC, trying to rack up a new [Nethack score](https://nethackscoreboard.org/players/T/Tommo.all.html).

You can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/ciraben), or reach me at [tom.on.github@gmail.com](mailto:tom.on.github@gmail.com).

Oh, and that's me, I'm Tom - welcome!
